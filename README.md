# Electron Chat App

## Things to Consider / Possible Future Additions
1. When loading the initial page of the app, we could jump straight to the chat app if name/number have been provided.
2. Use React.js for chat portion.
3. Integrate with 2FA style SMS service for verification code.
4. Add other country codes to phone number form select list.
5. Use JSDoc or similar style comments and generate documentation.
6. Support phone numbers in other formats, such as (xxx) xxx-xxxx and xxx-xxx-xxxx
7. Better/more robust storage system.
